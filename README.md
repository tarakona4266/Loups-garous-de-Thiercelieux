# [FR] Les loups-garous de Thiercelieux / [EN] The werewolves of Millers Hollow

*Work in progress !*

A text-based, console implementation of the french card game "The Werewolves of Millers Hollow".
This is a personal project to have more preactive while I learn C#. Once the console version is working nicely, I plan to make a graphical interface in Unity 6.

## Rules

<ins>Classic/simple game :</ins>

You can choose between 2 types of game :

• Classic : the full experience, with all the cards available *(not implemented yet)*

• Simple : siplified rules with only 3 cards (townfolks, werewolves and fortune teller)

<ins>Cards/roles :</ins>

• **Townfolk** : you must get rid of all the werewolves terrorizing Millers Hollow.

• **Werewolf** : your goal is to devour all the villagers.

• **Fortune Teller** : each night, you can reveal the role of a person of your choice. Only you know the result.

• **Witch** : you have 2 potion, one that heal and one that kill. Once a night, you can choose to use one on the person of your choice, yourself included.

• **Hunter** : when you die, you can shoot someone in an act of revenge.

• **Cupido** : at the start of the game, you designate two lovers who can't live without each other. If one die, the other will follow.

• **Little Girl** : you can spy the werewolves, but if you are discovered you'll die in place of their victim.

• **Thief** : before the start of the game, you can exchange your card with another player.
